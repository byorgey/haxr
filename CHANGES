  - allow base-compat-0.9

* 3000.11.1.2 (20 September 2015)

  - `>` is now escaped as `&gt;` when sending requests. Without this

  - Bug fix: don't crash with empty URI port

    XML-RPC spec.

    string with an XML element.  This should only affect users who
    depend on Network.XmlRpc.Internals.

* 3000.9.3 (18 May 2013)

    (hangs forever when trying to send a request).

    extra custom headers.  Thanks to Ben Sinclair for the patch.

* 3000.9.1 (4 May 2013)

  - Expose Network.XmlRpc.DTD_XMLRPC from the library

    The point is to allow converting to XML using functions from

      http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/HaXml/1.23.3/doc/html/Text-XML-HaXml-XmlContent.html

    which allows for custom serialization of the XML to deal with
    endpoints that don't parse XML correctly.

* 3000.9.0.1 (7 July 2012)

  - Make everything in examples/ directory compile again

* 3000.9 (7 July 2012)

    resulting in dramatically improved efficiency

  - Change the argument type of ValueBase64 constructor from String to
    ByteString
